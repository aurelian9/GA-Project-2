Our project began as an idea to be a platform for freelance tutors to connect with vendors of tutoring jobs (be they parents or otherwise and ease the troubles of finding freelance assignments/jobs as well as freelance tutors.

It is an app designed with freelance tutors and parents alike. 

Parents can create assignments or jobs and post them for tutors to view. 
Tutors can select and apply for the assignments or jobs they want. Parents can view and accept the applications. 
After accepting the applications, tutors and parents will be able to access each other's contact information to ease communication before assignment/job commencement.
